The goal of this project is to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. 
I will use the browser's developer tools and then write HTML / CSS to try to build the Google.com homepage. 
I will begin by putting the main elements on the page, then build the navbar and then add the footer. I will do as much as I can before consulting the code in developer tools. 
After this, I will push the project to GitHub. 
These instructions come from The Odin Project.
